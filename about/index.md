## <center>A little about my journey</center>

## Where I Started
I am an audiologist by trade. After attending graduate school in Philadelphia, I moved to south Florida
and worked for three years at a children's hospital and a school district. My work was rewarding. I got to
spend time with tons of awesome kids and help them to hear better, do better in school and improve their
overall quality of life. During summer vacation in 2015 I spent a month living and studying Spanish in Sevilla,
Spain. It was the first time I had ever been to continental Europe or Spain for that matter and I was absolutely
enamoured. I came home after that month and my life would never be the same. I decided I was going to quit my job
as an audiologist and move to Spain to teach English. A year later I was living in Madrid studying to get my
Teaching English as a Foreign Language certificate. A few months after that I was employed and taking full advantage
of living in southern Europe, traveling and exploring all over Spain. I wanted to share my experiences with my friends
and family back home so I started a blog, which leads me to the next step in my journey...

## How I got here
I was so excited to start this blog and post pictures and start telling my friends and family about all the
awesome adventures I was having. But I ran into a problem: none of the WordPress themes I found quite fit exactly
how I wanted my blog to look. So I started searching on YouTube for tutorials on how to customise my blog and I came
across a guy who was writing his own code! He wasn't confined to using pre-constructed frameworks that other people
had built; he was doing everything himself and making it all his own. I was hooked! Shortly thereafter I downloaded
my first text editor, started learning HTML and CSS and the rest is history!
